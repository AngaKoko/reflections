When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository is best used when it's a team working on the project and 
    we want the project to be available to everyone at any time in any location

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling change manually gives a better user experience, and you may not
    be ready to merge changes made by other team members working on the project
    just yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    *Fork is making copy of a repository on github. It is used when you want to 
    work on a project but dont have permission to edit it.
    *Clones are downloaded remote repository to a local machine. Clones are used
    when you want to work on a project offline
    *Branches contain history of a repository. A branch is used when we want to
    commit edited files


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The master branch will be a continuation of the origin/master branch and when
    we pull or push, it's going to be a fast-foward-merge
